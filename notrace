We go to the trail to see wildlife and special places. We go because it’s pristine. We go for wilderness and remote places. These environments are fragile. Please join generations of hikers in doing your best to protect these incredible trails.

We’re also committed to gold-standard Leave No Trace ethics. We choose responsible campsites far away from the trail and water. We’re quiet so that other people don’t get annoyed. We know that our human food can kill the wildlife we’re out there to see. We wash our feet and faces away from streams and springs to protect aquatic life and so you don’t drink our funk, sunscreen, and DEET. And we pack out our used toilet paper because animals are digging it up and too much is left on the surface along the trail.

Leave No Trace takes extra effort. But as hikers and horseback riders who have pulled long-distance permits, we implore you to join us in becoming an LNT champion. Your actions can either harm or protect the trail. What will your legacy be?
